# Building an Application

All of the previous steps should provide enough information to build a somewhat sophistic PHP application. Maybe nothing 
fancy, but something object-oriented, and with most of the components you will see in much more sophisticated 
applications.

Included in this directory will be a number of files putting all this knowledge into practice. It has an autoloader, 
interfaces, base classes, etc.

We are continuing with the animal examples, but pay attention to where things have renamed. I'm going to implement some 
common naming standards, put files in a source directory, and separate everything into different files.
